        <h2>Healthier Food, Healthy Families, Happier World</h2>
        <p>© 2021 Global Food Bank is not a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, 
            because it doesn’t actually exist. This organization was created as a 
            midterm project for the CS-20 Web Programming Class at Tufts University. 
            All rights are not reserved because this organization only exists in fantasy land. 
            We do not accept donations, nor have we ever, nor do we ever intend to. 
            Even that copyright symbol at the beginning of this paragraph? 
            Yeah, it’s a lie. We’re going out of our way to confuse you on the 
            theory that the only people who are going to read this are our TAs
             and the professor when they read this for grading purposes.</p>
        <p>To contact our Legal Team, please send an email to Legal@gfb.org. 
            Or don’t, because that’s not a real email, and our Legal Team isn’t real people. 
            I mean seriously, our founders are listed on this website as John and Jane Doe, 
            what did you expect? If we told you that our Legal Team was headed by Person McManface, 
            would you try to contact him? If you send anything to the above email, 
            I have no idea who will receive it. So go wild, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.
