Notice: The following facts come from https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-world-hunger

1.	11.3% of the world’s population is hungry. That’s roughly 805 million people who go undernourished on a daily basis, consuming less than the recommended 2,100 calories a day
2.	The world produces enough food to feed all 7 billion people, but those who go hungry either do not have land to grow food or money to purchase it. 
3.	10 countries that have achieved greatest success in reducing the total number of hungry people in proportion to their national population are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cuba, Georgia, Ghana, Kuwait, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, Thailand and Venezuela. 
4.	Poverty is the principal cause of hunger. The causes of poverty include poor people's lack of resources, an extremely unequal income distribution in the world and within specific countries, conflict, and hunger itself. 
5.	In 2010, an estimated 7.6 million children — more than 20,000 a day — died. Poor nutrition plays a role in at least half of these deaths. 
6.	Nearly 98% of worldwide hunger exists in underdeveloped countries. 
7.	Almost 1 in every 15 children in developing countries dies before the age of 5, most of them from hunger-related causes. 
8.	While hunger exists worldwide, 526 million hungry people live in Asia. 
9.	Over a quarter of the world's undernourished people live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Almost 1 in 4 people in this region is chronically hungry. 
10.	When a mother is undernourished during pregnancy, the baby is often born undernourished, too. Every year, 17 million children are born this way due to a mother’s lack of nutrition before and during pregnancy. 
11.	Similarly, women in hunger are so deficient of basic nutrients (like iron) that 315,000 die during childbirth from hemorrhaging every year.
